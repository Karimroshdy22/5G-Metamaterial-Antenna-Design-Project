# Enhanced Microstrip Antenna Design Using Metamaterials for 5G Communication Systems

Bachelor’s Graduation Project – Electronics and Communications Engineering (Class of 2025)


This project aims to enhance antenna performance — improving gain, bandwidth, and miniaturization — using metamaterial structures for 5G communication systems.

## 🧩 Project Overview
Two microstrip antennas were designed using CST Studio Suite.  
The results were analyzed and compared with published research using SigmaPlot and Plot Digitizer.

After simulation, one antenna was fabricated at the Electronics Research Institute (ERI – Cairo),  
and the second was integrated into a Nokia 6630 mobile phone in collaboration with Logic Need – Mansoura.

## ⚙️ Tools Used
